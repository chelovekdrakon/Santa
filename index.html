        <h3> Short description </h3>

        <p> You are a cosmos discoverer on a recently opened planet. Your task is save your live,  collect gold discs as many as possible, find key to secret station and get to it. </p>
        <p> But one more condition - your space suit has limited an oxygen supply. Don't waste time, you have only 60 items of time. </p>

        <h3> Rules</h3>

      <p>      You can kill enemies only if you jump on top of them. Be careful with abysses.       To move use keys with arrows, and to jump - the longest key on your keyboard (SPACE)</p>
